## About myself
I am pessionate about coding Because I love what I do in my code, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last coding homework, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use JQuery to improve the quality of my website. I will became the person who can coding in any language soon.
